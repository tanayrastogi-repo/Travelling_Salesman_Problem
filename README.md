# Travelling Salesman problem using Genetic Algorithm
We formulated a Genetic Algorithm structure to solve NP-hard Travelling Salesman problem.
In the project, we show the solution solving three different levels of maps.

- File GA.m is the main script and all the funtions are linked to this script.
In order to run, just press RUN(or F5 in windows).
